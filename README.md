# Estimating used car prices with Linear Regression (Craigslist Dataset)

Nearly everybody sooner or later needs to buy or sell a car. And every time people want to get a fair deal. There are actually two ways to find out a car price. First - to manually check prices on different car marketplaces like CarGurus, Autotrader, Craigslist, and then come up with a fair price based on those listings. People use this way a lot, but it has some disadvantages. For example, they can check just a small number of listings, and by not understanding the market well enough make a poor pricing decision that is biased towards very high or low price. 

Another way to find out a car value is to use services that can predict a trade-in value. Examples of such services would be Shift, Carfax and many others. They have access to huge car databases plus well trained machine learning models that can predict a price just based on a carâ€™s VIN number.  However, there is no information which models and algorithms they are using. One major disadvantage of those services is that they make money on trade-ins, so the predicted price will always be lower than a real market value, although it can give people at least some idea.

This project is located on the intersection between those two ways of pricing, so the goal is to eliminate all the disadvantages mentioned above and create a machine learning model that will predict a fair car selling price.
